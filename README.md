# pebble-sydney-bus-departures

>   A Simply.js Pebble app that gets Sydney Bus departures in realtime!

# Usage

- Clone the repo, or download the source

- Edit the `pebble.js` file with your desired bus stops (you can find stop codes from Google Maps or [TfNSW Trip Planner](https://transportnsw.info))

- Host the file somewhere. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a very good option (that's what I'm using right now)

- Add the link to your pebble.js file ([or try mine](https://jakecoppinger.com/pebble-sydney-bus-departures/pebble.js)) to the [Simply.js](http://simplyjs.io/) Pebble app through the smartphone companion app 

- Start the Simply.js app on your Pebble and marvel!
